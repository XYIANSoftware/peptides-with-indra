# Commit and push after tasks

When you finish a task that changes files in this project:

1. Stage the relevant changed files (do not add untracked files unless the user asked for them).
2. Commit with a clear, concise message describing what was done.
3. Push to the current branch (e.g. `origin/main`).

Do **not** commit and push if the user explicitly asks you not to (e.g. "don't push yet", "just commit locally", "wait to push").
